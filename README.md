# Danny-s-Ore-Collection
A Mod providing all the Ores you could ever dream of.

This mod adds 80 different types of ores. Each ore type comes in 33 different stone variants and 3 different richness types.
You can download the mod on curse forge:

This mod works stand alone; however, it doesn't add any items like ingots etc..
By default all ores (with some exceptions like vanilla ores, xp ore, etc.) drop themselves.
Because this mod adds no items it also adds no recipes (except for vanilla type ores);
however, all ores have forge ore tags and can be used in all recipes of other mods that provide tag support.

This mod also provides a lot of configuration options.
